# Retrieve the data if it doesn't already exist in the working directory

# Merge the training and test sets into one data set

# Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
# measurement

# Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

# Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

# Create a 2nd independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for
# each activity and each subject

# Output the data set

# Write tidy data set to text file with write.table using row.name = FALSE
